# Bitcoin Price Prediction and Trading Bots

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for predicting Bitcoin prices and implementing various trading strategies using machine learning models and trading bots. Below are the main components of the project:

1. **Deeplearn-neurallines:**
   - Predict Bitcoin Price using an LSTM Model.
   - Utilizes the past sixty days of 5-minute interval data from the Yahoo Finance API.

2. **chat_gpt_bitcoin_price_prediction:**
   - Predict Bitcoin Price using an LSTM Model.
   - Uses 1 year of historical data with a 5-minute interval.
   - The script fetches the latest day's data from the Yahoo Finance API whenever it is run.
   - Retrains the model with the new data and provides predictions.

3. **Grid Strategy:**
   - Implements a trading bot for the grid strategy.
   - Currently in testing mode; backtesting in progress.


4. **Scalping:**
   - Implements a trading bot for scalping.
   - Currently in testing mode; backtesting in progress.
